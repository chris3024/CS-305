#### Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial organization looking to modernize its offerings through the web. The issue was modernizing the offerings while also protecting the data.
#### What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I did very well identifying the possible vulnerabilities and bringing them to the forefront of the conversation. Coding securely is very important to protect not only the user base but also to protect the company from any harm, both in public opinion and financial.  
#### What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
All of the assessments were new to me. The thing that I found the most challenging was the static review of the code base. I had not worked with the Spring framework, so figuring out what was legit and not was a little tricky.  
#### How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased layers of security by running through an HTTPS connection and including some error handling. I would probably use a little of the same we used in this class.
#### How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
After I created the new code, I would run the dependency checks to make sure no new vulnerabilities were introduced. I would also then run the code and make sure the outputs were correct.  
#### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The internet is a significant resource that we have at our disposal. Also, the tools that were introduced in this course will be a help.
#### Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show how I could work on the requirements, identify the risks and potential shortfalls of the software, and how those were corrected and improved upon.
